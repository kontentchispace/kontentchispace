Notes for consideration
Please note, the room is not soundproofed. We have a soundproofed door and thus the room is sound dampened. Some external sound may be heard if the room is being used during the day or when workshops are on. It is advised to use the space during quiet times. The microphones we have pick up sound if at a close range and thus outside noise should not be picked up.
